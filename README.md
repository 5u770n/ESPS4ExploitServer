This is a project for ESP8266 Arduino boards. It has been tested on a (cloned?) Wemos D1 board with 4MByte flash. It uses SPIFFS to load 
files from the flash chip but can easily be ported to use an SD addon board.

Setting up the board:
Install the Arduino IDE if you don't already have it
Start the Arduino IDE
Install the ESP8266 library
Install the ESP8266 Filesystem Uploader - http://www.instructables.com/id/Using-ESP8266-SPIFFS/
Restart the Arduino IDE
Plug in the board and install the drivers for it
Under Tools:
  Select the board that is appropriate
  Select the COM port the board is attached to (can be found in the Device Manager in Windows)
  Select the Flash Size - The code is pretty small so you can use the option that has the most memory saved for SPIFFS Ex: 4M (1M/3M SPIFFS)
Load the .ino from the downloaded directory
In the /data directory place the payloads that
Unplug the board and hold down the Flash button while you plug it back in
Under Tools, select ESP8266 Sketch Data Uploader
If there is an error in transferring then unplug the board and hold the Flash button while plugging it back in again
If there is an error in creating the SPIFFS then you have files adding up to too much memory for what your board so remove some
Unplug the board and plug it back in
Under Sketch, select Upload

If you need to add/remove SPIFFS files then always use the Sketch Data Uploader before you upload the sketch. There seems to be a bug
that will trash the data in the program area of flash when you upload to the SPIFFS area in flash and the board won't run without the
sketch being uploaded again.

Usage:
It defaults to creating an access point 'ps4exploit' with password 'hackmyps4'. Set your PS4 gateway and DNS to 10.13.37.1 when the board 
is in AP mode. To change the configuration open a web browser to http://10.13.37.1/settings. Note that it is an unsecured webpage so the 
password for a wifi network that is entered in will be saved in plain text, but will only be accessible to those that can log onto the 
network already. In station mode, the IP for the board will attempt to use the default static IP containing '235'. Ex: 192.168.1.1 with 
subnet mask 255.255.255.0 will try the static IP of 192.168.1.235

Settings:
Selection of wifi mode - AP/Station
AP - Network name, password
Station - Available networks, password, static IP
Payload - Selection of available payloads loaded in flash

Operation:
It creates a web server and fake DNS server that resolves everything back to itself. It defaults back to sending the index.html on any 
request that doesn't match a file loaded into flash. SPIFFS doesn't allow for directories so the names of the different exploit pages and 
scripts (and references in their htmls) had to be renamed. Keep this in mind when adding new exploit pages. If other payload exploit pages 
are released you must add some code to set JS_MAX to the number of .js files loaded by the page to trigger the automatic payload setting.
After the IDC or Specter exploit pages are loaded through a web browser (or user manual on PS4), the payload transfer will automatically
start after a 1s wait. If it fails with a not enough memory error then it is best to restart the PS4 because it typically causes a 
soft-lock on the XMB after repeated attempts.

Failsafes (useful for when you can't reprogram the board):
Programmatically - If the board can connect to a wifi station then it will revert back to AP mode
                   If the static IP you select conflicts with the network you connect to then the network will assign one
Physically - Bridging D6 to GND while plugging the board into a power source will force it to load up the default AP settings so you can
             change the network settings (http://10.13.37.1/settings)

Known bugs:
The LED doesn't turn on steady after files are transferred (I think the problem is somewhere in the ESP8266 library)
Sometimes after a failed payload transfer the board will be stuck in a loop and need to be reset if you can't connect
